## SAP HANA Cloud

- SAP HANA Cloud is a database as a service that powers mission-critical applications and real-time analytics with one solution at petabyte scale.

-  SAP Hana cloud is a complete database and application development platform. By Combining In-Menory storage with columnar store, data operations are performed faster than in a traditional database with a disk-based storage.

## SAP HANA Database Deployment Infrastructure
SAP HANA Deployment Infrastructure (HDI) provides a service that enables you to deploy database development artifacts to so-called containers.These containers store design-time artifacts and deployed run-time objects for the HANA platform database. They include tables, views, functions, and procedures.

## Schema
schema is a logical container that organizes database content into sub-databases.
Schemas can be named statically or dynamically. Dynamic schema names are generated when an HDI Container is first created in the system. 

## Data Lake
A data lake is a centralized repository designed to store, process, and secure large amounts of structured, semistructured, and unstructured data.
